# Supermarket Sales Regression using H2O AutoML

## Project Overview
This project uses H2O Flow and AutoML to build regression models that predict supermarket sales.
The goal is to understand which factors influence total sales and customer ratings.

## Dataset
- File: dataset_regression_supermarket_sales.csv
- Source: Course-provided dataset
- Description: Contains transaction-level supermarket sales data including product, customer, and payment details.

## Tools & Technologies
- H2O Flow (AutoML)
- Java (H2O backend)
- MacOS

## Project Workflow
1. Launched H2O Flow locally using Java.
2. Imported the dataset into H2O Flow.
3. Verified column data types and distributions.
4. Converted categorical variables (enum) where required.
5. Defined the target variable for regression.
6. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
7. Used H2O AutoML to train multiple regression models.
8. Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R².
9. Reviewed feature importance and model leaderboard.

## Results
- AutoML selected the best-performing regression model based on validation metrics.
- Key predictors included unit price, quantity, and gross income.

## How to Run This Project
1. Install Java.
2. Download and run `h2o.jar`.
3. Open http://localhost:54321 in a browser.
4. Upload the `.flow` file using **Flow → Upload Flow**.
5. Import the dataset when prompted.

## Key Learnings
